# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. **Identify Technical Lead** for architecture guidance and design reviews
8. **Identify UX touchpoints** if project involves user-facing features (coordinate with UX Designer on design milestones and handoffs)
9. **Assign owner for risk register** (typically PM) to track and update risks throughout the project

- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
